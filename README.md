# Weather Dashboard
## Deployed page:
[Weather Dashboard](https://ericabreig.github.io/Le-weather-dashboard/)

## Description:
This was an assingment in coding bootcamp for third party APIS.  We were tasked to create an app using the [OpenWeather One Call API](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api), so that the user can find a 5-day weather forecast for multiple cities.
In this assignment, I practiced the following:
- Using API keys from server side APIs
- Utilizing fetch function
- Utilizing JSON with local storage
- Saving data to the local storage

### User Story

```
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
```
### Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
```

### Mock-Up

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:
